      <p>
        Hello! I am a current Research and Development Intern at Sandia National Labs working in the Autonomy for Hypersonics group. I am also a
        Master's student in Electrical Engineering at Missouri S&T. AT S&T, I work in the Lightwave Technology Laboratory (LTL) under Dr. Jie Huang
        and Dr. Rex E. Gerald II to perform research on photonic- and radio frequency-enabled sensors. My current research interests include microwave-photonic
        sensing technologies, machine learning, and stochastic signal analysis. Previously, I earned a BS in Electrical Engineering from Missouri S&T in May of
        2021. When not working in my lab or in class, I enjoy volunteering for New Student Programs as a PRO (Preview, Registration, and Orientation) Leader,
        exploring outside, and hanging out with my dog Leo.

              <p>I am currently pursuing a thesis-based Masters degree in electrical engineering under the advisement of Dr. Jie Huang. Before this,
              I graduated in May 2021 with my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, receiving Summa Cum Laude honors. My current degree
              focuses on electromagnetics, including signal integrity for high-speed electronic systems, microwaves, and optics.</p>

              <p>Through my time at S&T, I've gained a vast amount of experience working with electrical systems. My first internship with Paul Mueller Company
              allowed me to serve as a lead on a new product line of electric water purifiers, substantially expanding the companies clientel. Most recently, my
              my ongoing internship at Sandia National Labs has allowed me to work with PCB design, filter design, and various simulation techniques.</p>

      <p>In the next month, I will be holding two presentations. The first is in collaboration with the IEEE St. Louis section
      for their student presentation competition. My presentation title is "Metal Organic Framework for Sensing Conditions
      by Electronic Nose Technology (MOF-SCENT): A novel sensing technology for real-time detection of pulmonary disease."
      This will be held on October 9, 2021. The second presentation is in collaboration with the Chemistry and Biology departments
      of Missouri Southern State University. The date and title for this presentation is still pending. More information will be posted
      once available.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p>In August, 2021, I was asked to return for a second year to present the Miners Think mission of Opening Week,
        a week-long orientation for incoming freshmen to Missouri S&T. This presentation dealt with the harsh realities of
        college living and provided the proper resources available on campus to mitigate or resolve thes issues. The presentation
        was given to over 1200 freshmen in groups of approximately fifty students at a time.

      <p>In March, 2021, I presented to in the St. Louis Student Presentation Competition with the title of "
        A Real-time Sensor for Monitoring Degradation of Aluminum Armor Plates casued by Gallium Infiltration Attacks."
        I was awarded first place in the undergraduate technical section.

        on campus. The presentation, was given remotely to several groups of approximately fifteen students each and was tailored to best
        discuss the topics most necessary for each group.
